# Workflow

We had weekly meetings, with daily meetings towards the end of the project where everyone was able to update each other on their progress and decide the next step forward. These meetings usually began with a stand up and then followed by listing the next tasks to be done. Any issues are brought up and discussed. the tasks are then made into Issues on GitHub and assigned to someone to complete.

Our main form of version control is done through GitHub. Pull requests are against master and two people are requred to approve it before merging. This allowed everyone to familiarise themselves with the code in our project and allow questions to be brought up and discussed. Our main conflicts encountered during the development process were merge conflicts. Any large changes of code required a couple team members to get to together and resolve these conflicts together.

Overall, communication was the main driving factor of our team cohesiveness. Everyone's ability to speak up and ask for advice as soon as possible alo\lowed for an open environment and efficient resolution of problems. Lastly, everyone is proactive and willing to contribute to discussions and implementing the code via pair-programming or solo.
