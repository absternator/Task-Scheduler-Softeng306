## Command Line Interface
The Apache Commons CLI library was used to read the optional command line arguments. The first two arguments are read as String[] args. The Apache Commons CLI library help formatter is used to format and print the help statements for when a user inputs inappropriate arguments. Custom exceptions are also implemented to more accurately show where a user error has occurred.
